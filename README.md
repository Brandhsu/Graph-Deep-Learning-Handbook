# Graph-Deep-Learning-Handbook

Deep Learning is pretty cool, but Graph Deep Learning is cooler!

## Benchmarks
Standardized benchmarks for evaluating graph deep learning models.
* [Open Graph Benchmark](https://github.com/snap-stanford/ogb)
* [Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks](https://github.com/graphdeeplearning/benchmarking-gnns)

## Unsupervised Learning
Several presentations on unsupervised learning with graph deep learning models.
* [Unsupervised Learning with Graph Neural Networks](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/abstract/?tid=15546&pcode=GLWS4)
